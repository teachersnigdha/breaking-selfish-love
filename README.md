```
Brothers and friends, had become different,
Today they reunite,
Since long they lived far away,
Now they come together.

Their minds and souls become one,
They laugh and cry together,
Whole world is a family,
The bond is tied.

Today young and old, everyone is the same,
Race, religion is not required,
Religion of humanity, is established,
With karma as the great religion.

The great wall of rich and poor,
Has fallen down,
No one is there to lift it,
There is nobody to care.

Doctor, sweeper, or government,
Are revered by the countrymen,
The watchmen are great,
Great is the agriculture society.

In the court of the world, as many creatures as we,
We would love each other,
The cost of love, is incomparable,
Breaking selfish love.
