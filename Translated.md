```
Brother and friend, as different as it is,
Today is a couple,
How far away the black was,
It is now the Ghat Ghat.

One mind, one soul becomes one,
Laugh together,
A family, this catchment area,
The bond is tied.

Today, young and old, everyone is the same,
Race is not required,
Human religion, is established,
Karma is a great religion.

Rich and poor, he is a great wall,
Fell asleep
To climb the wall, to lift it,
No one cares

Doctor broom, or government,
The country is revered,
The watchman is great,
Great agricultural society.

In the courts of the world, as many creatures as we,
To love all to do,
The origin of love, not comparison,
Tutai selfish love.
```
